## Project 1 - Single Server, Key-Value Store (TCP and UDP) 
## There are four java classes in this project.

## TCP
## TCPServer
## This is the TCP server class. It should be started first. 
## It asks for the port number which caN be entered via the command line interface.
## TCPClient
## The TCP client can be started once the server is up and running.
## The client class asks for the hostname which can be entered as "localhost" and aLSo asks for the port number.
## The program then asks the user to enter the request. The hashmap that stores the key value pairs has pre-populated data.
## The program supports three requests and the user can make each of 5 (5 GET request or 5 PUT requests or 5 DELETE requests) :
## PUT : The user has to enter the request in the given format (Example : PUT key value). The request is sepertaed by spaces.
## GET : Even without entering values the user can fetch some details as the hashmap is pre-populated. If the value does not exist it gives key not found output. (Example : GET key)
## DELETE : The user can delete values from the hashmap (Example : DELETE key)
## Whenever the 5 PUT or GET or DELETE requests are fulfilled it shows the message in the CLI and continues till all the three operations got five of each request.
## If any request other that these are made it gives an invalid request output and tells you to make an appropriate request.

## UDP
## UDP Server
## This is the UDP server class. It should be started first.
## It asks for the port number which can be entered via the command line interface.
## UDP Client
## The UDP client can be started once the server is up and running.
## The client class asks for the hostname which can be entered as "localhost" and aLso asks for the port number.
## The program then asks the user to enter the request. The hashmap that stores the key value pairs has pre-populated data.
