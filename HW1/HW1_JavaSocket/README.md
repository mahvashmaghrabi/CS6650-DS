# Java Socket Programming
# There are two classes the client class and the server class
# First the main method of the server class is supposed to run which runs and asks you to enter the port number Eg: 32000
# Next the main method of the client class should be started
# It asks the user to enter the port number (Also has a validation check)
# Then the IP address (Enter "localhost")
# And the string/text to be reversed which is given to the server.
# All this should be entered in the command line argument of the client terminal.
# The server then takes the string reverses the string and the capitalization.
# The output is printed on the client side and the connection closes after one text/string is given to it. 
# A new connection needs to be established to give another string input to the server.
